# Hand Tracker with OpenCV and MediaPipe

This project is a real-time hand-tracking application that uses OpenCV for video processing and MediaPipe for detecting and tracking hand landmarks. The application captures video from your camera, detects hand landmarks, and overlays the hand skeleton and additional visual elements like FPS display.

## Features

- Real-time hand detection and tracking.
- Displays hand landmarks and connections on the video feed.
- Highlights specific hand landmarks (e.g., the palm base).
- Calculates and displays frames-per-second (FPS) for performance monitoring.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7, 3.8, or 3.9
- OpenCV 4.5+ (`opencv-python`)
- MediaPipe library (`mediapipe`)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand_tracker.git
   cd hand_tracker
